* This contains notes from Hadley's Tidy Tools clases: https://github.com/hadley/tidy-tools.  
* I find the slides hard to search so I made a single RMarkdown document that combines the slides and code.
* When complete it will have material from both the Atlanta and Garvin classes.

It combines Hadley's slides and code snippets and my notes.

> My notes appear like this.  The rest is very close to his material.
